Originally this began as a basic hockey game simulator based on the NHL league average shooting percentage for 2023/2024. I have gradually built it out to simulate the entire NHL season. This simulator can be run a set amount of times to get good sample size on playoff odds.

7/5/2024 - Goalie stats for a single season are now tracked.

8/27/2024 - Goalies now will only start a maximum of 65 games per season.

9/1/2024 - Added roles to each skater to weigh team offenses and defenses more accurately.

10/2/2024 - Now reads NHL schedule and results from .csv to update playoff odds throughout the season.

11/8/2024 - Powerplay, Penalty Kill, and penalty differential logic implemented.
